				<h3><b>Kickstand Bicycles</b></h3>
				<p>Branding, logo, &amp; web design for a neighborhood bike shop in Chattanooga, TN.</p>
				<p>Jacobo Salazar Jr. is the type of person who, once met, is not easily forgetten. He is a free spirit whose own life has brought him places, and most recently, the Chattanooga neighborhood of St. Elmo.</p>
				<p>My approach to Kickstand Bicycles had to match Jacobo's approach to bikes. He loves each bike like they're his children—taking great care of each part and making sure every bike is road ready.  He frequently gives away parts and labor to people who can't afford it. That's the kind of business this is.</p>
				<p>So when setting out to design the logo, I wanted it to be friendly, neighborly, fun, and professional. The business cards, website, and collateral followed suit.</p>
				<p>Jacobo recently won a business start-up challenge in Chattanooga's LAUNCH program. Here's what he had to say:</p>
				<blockquote>&ldquo;We started off with 17 or 20 and by the third week we dwindled to 12, then 9, then 8. But if you want to succeed, then go for it. Because it really is a streamlined business class for poor people. I mean, I'm broke. I have a little bit of savings, but c'mon. If you have a dream, then take Launch.&rdquo;</blockquote>
				<p>If you'd like to support Jacobo and Kickstand, give him a call at 503-804-6399. Trust me, that's the best way to reach him.</p>
